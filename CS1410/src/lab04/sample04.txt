    The assignment

</center>

<p>
The goal of this assignment is to practice using Java variables, 'if'
statements, and loops.&nbsp; In addition, I expect that most students
will need to experiment a bit to solve parts #2 and #3.&nbsp; This
experimentation is the most important part of the assignment - I want
you to <i> practice writing bits of code simply to see what they will
do. </i>
</p>

<h4> Part 1: </h4>

<p>
Consider this series of numbers:
</p>

<p>
<tt> 3  10  5  16  8  4  2  1 </tt>
</p>

<p>
Starting with a positive integer <i> N </i> , the series is computed with a simple iterative computation:
</p>

<ul>
<li> If the current integer <i> N </i> is even, the next number is computed as <i> N / 2 </i> . </li>
<li> If the current integer <i> N </i> is odd, the next number is computed as <i> N * 3 + 1 </i> . </li>
<p>
Repeat.
</p>
</ul>
