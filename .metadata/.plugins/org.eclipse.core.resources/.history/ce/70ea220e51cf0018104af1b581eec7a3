Programming Assignment 3: Autocomplete


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe how your firstIndexOf() method in BinarySearchDeluxe.java
 *  finds the first index of a key that equals the search key.

/******************************************************************************
 *  What is the order of growth of the number of compares (in the
 *  worst case) that each of the operations in the Autocomplete
 *  data type make, as a function of the number of terms n and the
 *  number of matching terms m?
 *
 *  Recall that with order-of-growth notation, you should discard
 *  leading coefficients and lower-order terms, e.g., m^2 + m log n.
