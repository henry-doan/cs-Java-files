/**
 * This program sees the lowest possible integer a hailstone cannot produce.
 * 
 * At the beginning of the program, it seems like the program never finishes and the system out 
 * print when the loop is finished will never print. With some debugging with the commented out code 
 * the number never actually reaches a billion and the highest number it reaches is 1.6777216E7. The reason
 * is that a float is only holds 4 bytes of storage in the system so the maximum number is 1.6777216E7 and will
 * never truly hit one billion.
