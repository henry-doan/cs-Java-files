     * and the sun moving) the other people will catch up.
     * 
     * The elements have a set position in their own methods and then in this method is where it moves and characteristics.
     * the people goes from left to right, but at different speed by dividing the initial x value by various numbers
     * a higher number is a slower movement speed while the lowest value is the faster movements. 
     * 
     * The Sun moves not only from left to right but in a sin wave with the speed similar to the person speed, where the
     * lower values are faster and greater values are slower. 
     * 
     * The tree top gets the scale be bigger so it make it bigger every 2 seconds, and the reason why the trunk
     * is moving is because it is trying to be in the center of the treetop and that is why it is moving.
